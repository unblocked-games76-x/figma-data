      "description": "Change multiple texts in a batch, without having to click on each of them first. Paste new-line delimited texts into the several layers at once.How the plugin works:• Plugin will find every visible, unlocked text layer, and show you the input for each of them, letting you change all the texts in one take.• Plugin is aware of text layer positions and nesting layers, and ordering inputs depending on layer positions from top left to bottom right.• Completely keyboard accessible — select next field with TAB, change texts with ENTER, cancel with ESCHow to use:1. Select all the layers you want to be changed. If there is a Group or Frame within the selection, the plugin will find every unlocked visible text layer inside the selection.2. Call the plugin and change texts in the needed layers. Navigate between fields with Tab / Shift+Tab.You also can paste multiple lines at once. Hold Shift while pasting, and every new line from copied text will be pasted into its own field. Copying with Shift will copy texts from currently selected input and all inputs down from it will be copied to clipboard with new lines as delimiters. (It is handy to past the set of text in another group of layers using Retextifier)3. Click \"Change\" or press Enter. All changes would be applied. Mixed formatting for the layers that have been changed will be dropped.See some details and video preview on Twitter: https://twitter.com/aswellasyouare/status/1179063309280174081Also, follow me there to not miss new updates and announcements.Added in version 4:• Text layer corresponding with the currently active input now selected on canvas, so you can see more clearly which layer you will be changing.• Input orders now depend on position and nesting of the layers. If the top leftmost object among the selected is a group or a frame, all the text layers inside it will be placed in the list of inputs first, and so on.• Now you can copy multiple layers from inputs. When you press Cmd+Shift+C texts from the currently selected input and all inputs down from it will be copied to clipboard with new lines as delimiters.• Now tabs also work as delimiters with multiline paste. With that, you can copy-paste rows from Google Sheets and other places.Added in version 10:• Now the plugin finally works correctly on Windows! Had to implement some tricky logic handling new lines on Windows, and now everything should work as expected.• Starting from this version, the plugin preserves the name of the layer when changing the text. This will ensure that changing the texts won't disrupt smart animate or propagating defaults from main components into instances. Whenever you need to match layer name back to the text content, you could use “Reset Text Layer Name” plugin.Added in version 13:• Since recently, Figma no longer allows developers the access to paste events from the code, which means that I can no longer assign a custom shortcut for the multipaste feature.• Therefore, in this version, instead of a shortcut, there will be a multiline paste checkbox. The regular paste shortcut will now act as multipaste, meaning that every new row in your clipboard will be pasted into its own field in the plugin. Checkbox is on by default, but you can also uncheck the checkbox and paste into each field individually.• This somewhat worsens the experience, but it is the only thing I can do for now to make plugin work.

All the cool kids these days draw with the keyboard!This plugin turns your keyboard into a canvas. By simply pressing keys, vector nodes in that key's location appear on the frame. Try it out and see what drawings you can create!Tips:1. Keyboard Doodler connects the vector points you draw. To end the current vector, press return (↵).2. Your drawings are based on the keys' location in the generated keyboard frame. You can rearrange the keys on the generated keyboard to match your keyboard's layout.----Developed by Amanda Yeh and Josh Shi | Github Repo",

All the cool kids these days draw with the keyboard!This plugin turns your keyboard into a canvas. By simply pressing keys, vector nodes in that key's location appear on the frame. Try it out and see what drawings you can create!Tips:1. Keyboard Doodler connects the vector points you draw. To end the current vector, press return (↵).2. Your drawings are based on the keys' location in the generated keyboard frame. You can rearrange the keys on the generated keyboard to match your keyboard's layout.----Developed by Amanda Yeh and Josh Shi | Github Repo",

Your clients, and yourself, deserve better content.Whether you are designing an app or a website, UI Copy will help you come up with better copy for your layout‘s content.The plugin is not AI-based. We used our wordsmithing intelligence to analyze thousands of conversion-oriented websites and built a repository of words and phrases that you can apply in your marketing copy. No AI tool can do that.🤙 UI Copy emphasizes two key features:Voice and Tone. Helps you sound either casual and witty or as a soulless corporate suit. As you might‘ve guessed, we prefer the former, but we are still being objective and balance the repository with 50/50 of each.Smart Variables. We used the syntactic constructions of the English language to predict where things stay stable in a sentence and sprinkle in variables to assemble phrases for your specific need.🤘 Give it a try.

Your clients, and yourself, deserve better content.Whether you are designing an app or a website, UI Copy will help you come up with better copy for your layout‘s content.The plugin is not AI-based. We used our wordsmithing intelligence to analyze thousands of conversion-oriented websites and built a repository of words and phrases that you can apply in your marketing copy. No AI tool can do that.🤙 UI Copy emphasizes two key features:Voice and Tone. Helps you sound either casual and witty or as a soulless corporate suit. As you might‘ve guessed, we prefer the former, but we are still being objective and balance the repository with 50/50 of each.Smart Variables. We used the syntactic constructions of the English language to predict where things stay stable in a sentence and sprinkle in variables to assemble phrases for your specific need.🤘 Give it a try. If you want a discount for an exchange of feedback, write to us before making a purchase.👉 Official website: uicopy.io",

Go to Plugins > Safely Delete Components > Safe Delete (or ⌘+/ > \"Safe Delete\")\n3. This component will be deleted if there are no instances of it in the document\n\n🧹  Delete Unused Components\n\n1. Go to Plugins > Safely Delete Components > Delete Unused Components (or ⌘+/ > \"Delete Unused Components\")\n2. The plugin will find components with no instances and delete them\n\nWhen the plugin finishes its work, you'll see which components have been deleted.\n\nBe aware that this plugin can be very slow with large documents, especially when working with unused components.",

On the other hand, unused components clutter up your document.\n\nSafely Delete Components does two things:\n\n🗑  Safe Delete\n\n1. Select a component you want to delete\n2. Go to Plugins > Safely Delete Components > Safe Delete (or ⌘+/ > \"Safe Delete\")\n3. This component will be deleted if there are no instances of it in the document\n\n🧹  Delete Unused Components\n\n1. Go to Plugins > Safely Delete Components > Delete Unused Components (or ⌘+/ > \"Delete Unused Components\")\n2. The plugin will find components with no instances and delete them\n\nWhen the plugin finishes its work, you'll see which components have been deleted.\n\nBe aware that this plugin can be very slow with large documents, especially when working with unused components.",

      "description": "Text Style Creator is a handy Figma plugin that automates the process of creating text styles from your text layers.Usage:Select your text layer(s).Run the plugin.The plugin will create a new text style for each unique set of text properties.Features:Creates new text styles based on the properties of your selected text layers and immediately applies them.Avoids duplicating styles with the same properties, even across different text contents.Notifies you if no layers are selected, how many new styles have been created, how many existing styles were skipped, and applies the created styles to the selected text.Feature Updates:Bulk Selection Support: Enhanced to support bulk selection, ensuring when multiple text layers with the same properties are selected, only one unique style is created, reducing redundancy and clutter.Automatic Style Application: Added functionality to automatically apply the created text style to the selected text layers, streamlining your workflow.Efficient Style Management: Continues to prevent the creation of new styles for layers that already match an existing style, maintaining a tidy style library.Please note: This plugin only works with text layers and uses the text content as the style name. It's designed to be a simple, run-once tool to help streamline your design workflow in Figma.Kishor on Dribbble and InstagramPlease give Text Style Creator a try and see if it suits your needs. Looking forward to your valuable feedback!",

              "description": "Text Style Creator is a handy Figma plugin that automates the process of creating text styles from your text layers.Usage:Select your text layer(s).Run the plugin.The plugin will create a new text style for each unique set of text properties.Features:Creates new text styles based on the properties of your selected text layers and immediately applies them.Avoids duplicating styles with the same properties, even across different text contents.Notifies you if no layers are selected, how many new styles have been created, how many existing styles were skipped, and applies the created styles to the selected text.Feature Updates:Bulk Selection Support: Enhanced to support bulk selection, ensuring when multiple text layers with the same properties are selected, only one unique style is created, reducing redundancy and clutter.Automatic Style Application: Added functionality to automatically apply the created text style to the selected text layers, streamlining your workflow.Efficient Style Management: Continues to prevent the creation of new styles for layers that already match an existing style, maintaining a tidy style library.Please note: This plugin only works with text layers and uses the text content as the style name. It's designed to be a simple, run-once tool to help streamline your design workflow in Figma.Kishor on Dribbble and InstagramPlease give Text Style Creator a try and see if it suits your needs. Looking forward to your valuable feedback!",

Be confident every design you hand-off is 100% consistent with your Style Guide or Design System. How to use Roller:1 - Import or add your styles to the Roller Library2 - Roller then automatically finds any inconsistencies (Errors) on the page that don’t match what is in your Library3 - Replace the Error with one of your Library’s styles4 - Rinse & repeat to reach 100% consistency Lint in the following categories:• Colors - Quickly fix the 50 (or 5,000) shades of gray that are lurking in your designs. • Text - If a subtle line-height or letter-spacing is off, Roller will pick them up and get you back on system. • Borders - Roller lets you add the width and colors of your borders - making it easy to find any rogue input field or card. • Shadows - Roller gives you superhuman eyes - making it possible to detect subtle differences in shadow blurs or x, y offsets. • Radiuses - Be confident that any button, card, input etc. has the correct border-radiuses applied. Keep your team in-sync:Roller lets you store and share your Library with teammates. Make sure everyone on your team has up-to-date resources and styles when linting.",

Be confident every design you hand-off is 100% consistent with your Style Guide or Design System. How to use Roller:1 - Import or add your styles to the Roller Library2 - Roller then automatically finds any inconsistencies (Errors) on the page that don’t match what is in your Library3 - Replace the Error with one of your Library’s styles4 - Rinse & repeat to reach 100% consistency Lint in the following categories:• Colors - Quickly fix the 50 (or 5,000) shades of gray that are lurking in your designs. • Text - If a subtle line-height or letter-spacing is off, Roller will pick them up and get you back on system. • Borders - Roller lets you add the width and colors of your borders - making it easy to find any rogue input field or card. • Shadows - Roller gives you superhuman eyes - making it possible to detect subtle differences in shadow blurs or x, y offsets. • Radiuses - Be confident that any button, card, input etc. has the correct border-radiuses applied. Keep your team in-sync:Roller lets you store and share your Library with teammates. Make sure everyone on your team has up-to-date resources and styles when linting.",

These constraints will generate a color palette based on that key color. You can choose to test and find out more information, or set the color styles for your file based on these results.If you'd like a video walkthrough on how I use this tool, you can see that here on my Youtube Channel.This tool leverages the work done by Nate Baldwin on LeonardoColor.io, an open source color tool, to bring similar functionality into generating test palettes, and updating styles in your system. Thus allowing you to check your work with more data from their tool.If you have any questions, you can reach out to me on Twitter at @darianrosebrook",

These constraints will generate a color palette based on that key color. You can choose to test and find out more information, or set the color styles for your file based on these results.If you'd like a video walkthrough on how I use this tool, you can see that here on my Youtube Channel.This tool leverages the work done by Nate Baldwin on LeonardoColor.io, an open source color tool, to bring similar functionality into generating test palettes, and updating styles in your system. Thus allowing you to check your work with more data from their tool.If you have any questions, you can reach out to me on Twitter at @darianrosebrook",

Use the Figma plugin to quickly include translated content in your designs without going back and forth with product managers, translators and developers.This Figma plugin allows you to:- Push texts from Figma to Lokalise- Set key names (unique identifiers that are used for representing text in code and your design) or use any of the patterns for automatic naming- Match Figma texts to existing Lokalise keys (and existing translations)- Pull translated texts from Lokalise to Figma- Seamlessly switch languages in Figma and check if your design works in other languagesLaunch the plugin1. Open your Figma project2. Go to the Plugins section and choose Lokalise3. Connect your Lokalise account4. Allow Figma to access your Lokalise workspace.5. Go back to Figma and select one of the existing Lokalise projects or create a new one. You can also set the default key naming pattern and the default platform for the newly created keys (this applies to the keys this Figma plugin will create in Lokalise).6. Click Finish Setup.When the setup is complete. Start using the plugin by pushing your Figma strings to the Lokalise project so translators can start working on them right away.For more information (with screenshots) check out the detailed documentation pagehttps://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/3732824-figmaThis plugin requires a paid Lokalise account (14-day free trial).",

Use the Figma plugin to quickly include translated content in your designs without going back and forth with product managers, translators and developers.This Figma plugin allows you to:- Push texts from Figma to Lokalise- Set key names (unique identifiers that are used for representing text in code and your design) or use any of the patterns for automatic naming- Match Figma texts to existing Lokalise keys (and existing translations)- Pull translated texts from Lokalise to Figma- Seamlessly switch languages in Figma and check if your design works in other languagesLaunch the plugin1. Open your Figma project2. Go to the Plugins section and choose Lokalise3. Connect your Lokalise account4. Allow Figma to access your Lokalise workspace.5. Go back to Figma and select one of the existing Lokalise projects or create a new one. You can also set the default key naming pattern and the default platform for the newly created keys (this applies to the keys this Figma plugin will create in Lokalise).6. Click Finish Setup.When the setup is complete. Start using the plugin by pushing your Figma strings to the Lokalise project so translators can start working on them right away.For more information (with screenshots) check out the detailed documentation pagehttps://docs.lokalise.com/en/articles/3732824-figmaThis plugin requires a paid Lokalise account (14-day free trial).",

Simply create a table in Coda, and use the plugin to fill your designs with content from the tables.→ To use this plugin1. Create a Coda doc with a table in it, or use the example doc that's provided. The example doc already has data for you to get started with.2. Fill individual layers by selecting the layer you want to change, and then select the relevant column in the plugin selector.3. Group layers, or create a component, to keep related info together.4. Select an entire frame or multiple groups to update all of the layers at once.→ Live DataTo pull live data into your Figma designs, create a Packs Table in Coda. Using Packs you can pull in data from Wikipedia, Spotify, Intercom and more. Once you've set up your table, you can connect your design to that table and watch it fill up with real data.→ Custom DataTo pull custom data into your Figma docs, create a Table in Coda. You can enter text, image URLs, formulas, and more. Then, connect your layers to that table, and watch your designs fill up with your own data.See more info here: https://coda.io/d/Example-data-doc_dFOHtXx4pnz",

Simply create a table in Coda, and use the plugin to fill your designs with content from the tables.→ To use this plugin1. Create a Coda doc with a table in it, or use the example doc that's provided. The example doc already has data for you to get started with.2. Fill individual layers by selecting the layer you want to change, and then select the relevant column in the plugin selector.3. Group layers, or create a component, to keep related info together.4. Select an entire frame or multiple groups to update all of the layers at once.→ Live DataTo pull live data into your Figma designs, create a Packs Table in Coda. Using Packs you can pull in data from Wikipedia, Spotify, Intercom and more. Once you've set up your table, you can connect your design to that table and watch it fill up with real data.→ Custom DataTo pull custom data into your Figma docs, create a Table in Coda. You can enter text, image URLs, formulas, and more. Then, connect your layers to that table, and watch your designs fill up with your own data.See more info here: https://coda.io/d/Example-data-doc_dFOHtXx4pnz",

Made with workflow speed and performance in mind.PurposeIt solves a need to see how items are related to each other by visually connecting them. Original purpose is to design complex systems and their architecture.TerminologyItem - is any figma element (text, frame, group, image)Flow - is a line that goes from item -> to itemHow to useCreate/Update flow - select the first and the second items by holding shift.Delete flow - set 'lock' switch to disabled state, select flow directly and delete it by pressing [Delete].Get static flow - select flows you need, group them by pressing [Ctrl + G] and move outside the 'ItemFlow' groupInterface guide is in the cover art or on imgurTechnical stuffThe more flows you got, the less frequent plugin will update them in order to save you fps.There are many plugins like that, why am i copying their ideas?(UX opinion from september 2021) I tried many free plugins to create flows and all of them had great implementations of how it should be, but they also got weak sides to do architecture stuff.Get the source code and/or contribute GithubBecause its free, i feel in power to advertise our group :)We are designing mmorpg and looking for enthusiasts",

Made with workflow speed and performance in mind.PurposeIt solves a need to see how items are related to each other by visually connecting them. Original purpose is to design complex systems and their architecture.TerminologyItem - is any figma element (text, frame, group, image)Flow - is a line that goes from item -> to itemHow to useCreate/Update flow - select the first and the second items by holding shift.Delete flow - set 'lock' switch to disabled state, select flow directly and delete it by pressing [Delete].Get static flow - select flows you need, group them by pressing [Ctrl + G] and move outside the 'ItemFlow' groupInterface guide is in the cover art or on imgurTechnical stuffThe more flows you got, the less frequent plugin will update them in order to save you fps.There are many plugins like that, why am i copying their ideas?(UX opinion from september 2021) I tried many free plugins to create flows and all of them had great implementations of how it should be, but they also got weak sides to do architecture stuff.Get the source code and/or contribute GithubBecause its free, i feel in power to advertise our group :)We are designing mmorpg and looking for enthusiasts",
