      "description": "<p>Transform your Figma designs into interactive, production-ready prototypes with Phase</p><p>• Create animations and interactions that actually ship to production</p><p>• Export as React components - no more design-to-code translation issues (Beta Release)</p><p>• Enable multiple simultaneous interactions (impossible in Figma alone)</p><p>• Work seamlessly between Figma and Phase with automatically organized interactions</p><p>• Professional animation tools: keyframes, motion paths, easing curves, and animation presets</p><p>• Real-time collaboration with developers and stakeholders</p><p><br></p><p>Join thousands of designers who bridge the gap between design and development! 🚀</p><p><br></p><p>Getting started is incredibly simple:</p><p>1 Select your design - Choose frames, components, or groups to export</p><p>2 Click Import - Phase allows you to choose to turn your variants into interactions (Please note that nested components are not yet supported due to Figma's flattened component system, but we're working on it! :-)</p><p>3 Open in Phase - Your designs are ready with interactions converted to Actions</p><p>4 Enhance &amp; Export - Add animations and export as code or media files</p><p><br></p><p>If you like learning with videos, checkout our demo: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" href=\"https://youtu.be/dn8JnLu-KqI\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/dn8JnLu-KqI</a></p><p><br></p><p>Features</p><p>🎯 Design to Code, Seamlessly</p><p>Unlike other prototyping tools, Phase exports your animations and interactions as production-ready React components. What you design is what gets built.</p><p>⚡ Multiple Simultaneous Interactions</p><p>Break free from Figma's limitations. Run multiple animations and interactions at the same time - just like in real applications.</p><p>🎨 Professional Animation Control</p><p>• Keyframes - Precise control over every animation property</p><p>• Path Animations - Motion paths for curved movements, trim paths for draw-on effects, and path morphing for shape transformations</p><p>• Animation Presets - ready-to-use animation effects (fade, scale, spin, trim, and more)</p><p>• Advanced Easing - Bezier curves, elastic, bounce, and custom easing</p><p><br></p><p>🔄 Import your Figma Interactions</p><p>You can choose to convert your Interactive components from Figma to Phase Actions.</p><p>🚀 Export Options That Matter</p><p>• React Components - Production-ready code</p><p>• Lottie - Lightweight animations for web and mobile</p><p>• Video/GIF - For presentations and social media</p><p>• dotLottie - Compressed animations with smaller file sizes</p><p><br></p><p>👥 Built for Teams</p><p>• Real-time collaboration with multi-cursor support</p><p>• Version history and commenting</p><p>• Share prototypes with stakeholders instantly</p><p><br></p><p>What makes Phase different?</p><p>From Design to Development</p><p>While other tools stop at visual prototypes, Phase generates actual code. Your beautiful interactions become real features, not just demos.</p><p>True Interactivity</p><p>Create conditional logic, decision-based flows, and complex user journeys. Phase combines visual design with programming logic.</p><p>Developer-Friendly</p><p>No more \"lost in translation\" between design and development. Developers receive clean, organized React components they can actually use.</p><p><br></p><p>Current Limitations</p><p>We believe in transparency. Here's what to expect:</p><p>• Borders become centered in Phase</p><p>• Text underlines and emojis aren't supported yet</p><p>• Blur/shadow effects may appear differently</p><p>• Polygons convert to paths</p><p>• Code export doesn’t support booleans and some animations yet because translating the canvas into code is really hard.. we’re working on it and shipping fast!</p><p>•We can’t yet support importing nested components because Figma’s flattened design system is not compatible, we’re figuring out a workaround!</p><p><br></p><p>These limitations are temporary as we continuously improve the plugin.</p><p><br></p><p>FAQ</p><p>Can I use Phase without coding knowledge?</p><p>Absolutely! Phase is designed for designers. The code export is a bonus for developer handoff, but you never need to write code yourself.</p><p>What happens to my Figma interactions?</p><p>They're automatically converted to Phase Actions, ready for enhancement with advanced animations.</p><p>Can I collaborate with my team?</p><p>Yes! Phase supports real-time collaboration, commenting, and version history. Share via restricted links, remix links, or prototype-only links.</p><p>What export formats are supported?</p><p>• Code: React components with CSS &amp; JavaScript (Beta Release)</p><p>• Animation: GIF, MP4, Lottie (.json), dotLottie (.lottie)</p><p>• All exports maintain your animation timing and interactions</p><p>Is it free to try?</p><p>Yes! Phase is free to use.</p><p><br></p><p>We're here to help you succeed:</p><p>📧 Email: support@phase.com</p><p>💬 Community: Join our community: https://community.phase.com/c/questions/</p><p><br></p><p>⠀</p><p>Ready to ship real interactions?

              "description": "<p>Transform your Figma designs into interactive, production-ready prototypes with Phase</p><p>• Create animations and interactions that actually ship to production</p><p>• Export as React components - no more design-to-code translation issues (Beta Release)</p><p>• Enable multiple simultaneous interactions (impossible in Figma alone)</p><p>• Work seamlessly between Figma and Phase with automatically organized interactions</p><p>• Professional animation tools: keyframes, motion paths, easing curves, and animation presets</p><p>• Real-time collaboration with developers and stakeholders</p><p><br></p><p>Join thousands of designers who bridge the gap between design and development! 🚀</p><p><br></p><p>Getting started is incredibly simple:</p><p>1 Select your design - Choose frames, components, or groups to export</p><p>2 Click Import - Phase allows you to choose to turn your variants into interactions (Please note that nested components are not yet supported due to Figma's flattened component system, but we're working on it! :-)</p><p>3 Open in Phase - Your designs are ready with interactions converted to Actions</p><p>4 Enhance &amp; Export - Add animations and export as code or media files</p><p><br></p><p>If you like learning with videos, checkout our demo: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow ugc\" href=\"https://youtu.be/dn8JnLu-KqI\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/dn8JnLu-KqI</a></p><p><br></p><p>Features</p><p>🎯 Design to Code, Seamlessly</p><p>Unlike other prototyping tools, Phase exports your animations and interactions as production-ready React components. What you design is what gets built.</p><p>⚡ Multiple Simultaneous Interactions</p><p>Break free from Figma's limitations. Run multiple animations and interactions at the same time - just like in real applications.</p><p>🎨 Professional Animation Control</p><p>• Keyframes - Precise control over every animation property</p><p>• Path Animations - Motion paths for curved movements, trim paths for draw-on effects, and path morphing for shape transformations</p><p>• Animation Presets - ready-to-use animation effects (fade, scale, spin, trim, and more)</p><p>• Advanced Easing - Bezier curves, elastic, bounce, and custom easing</p><p><br></p><p>🔄 Import your Figma Interactions</p><p>You can choose to convert your Interactive components from Figma to Phase Actions.</p><p>🚀 Export Options That Matter</p><p>• React Components - Production-ready code</p><p>• Lottie - Lightweight animations for web and mobile</p><p>• Video/GIF - For presentations and social media</p><p>• dotLottie - Compressed animations with smaller file sizes</p><p><br></p><p>👥 Built for Teams</p><p>• Real-time collaboration with multi-cursor support</p><p>• Version history and commenting</p><p>• Share prototypes with stakeholders instantly</p><p><br></p><p>What makes Phase different?</p><p>From Design to Development</p><p>While other tools stop at visual prototypes, Phase generates actual code. Your beautiful interactions become real features, not just demos.</p><p>True Interactivity</p><p>Create conditional logic, decision-based flows, and complex user journeys. Phase combines visual design with programming logic.</p><p>Developer-Friendly</p><p>No more \"lost in translation\" between design and development. Developers receive clean, organized React components they can actually use.</p><p><br></p><p>Current Limitations</p><p>We believe in transparency. Here's what to expect:</p><p>• Borders become centered in Phase</p><p>• Text underlines and emojis aren't supported yet</p><p>• Blur/shadow effects may appear differently</p><p>• Polygons convert to paths</p><p>• Code export doesn’t support booleans and some animations yet because translating the canvas into code is really hard.. we’re working on it and shipping fast!</p><p>•We can’t yet support importing nested components because Figma’s flattened design system is not compatible, we’re figuring out a workaround!</p><p><br></p><p>These limitations are temporary as we continuously improve the plugin.</p><p><br></p><p>FAQ</p><p>Can I use Phase without coding knowledge?</p><p>Absolutely! Phase is designed for designers. The code export is a bonus for developer handoff, but you never need to write code yourself.</p><p>What happens to my Figma interactions?</p><p>They're automatically converted to Phase Actions, ready for enhancement with advanced animations.</p><p>Can I collaborate with my team?</p><p>Yes! Phase supports real-time collaboration, commenting, and version history. Share via restricted links, remix links, or prototype-only links.</p><p>What export formats are supported?</p><p>• Code: React components with CSS &amp; JavaScript (Beta Release)</p><p>• Animation: GIF, MP4, Lottie (.json), dotLottie (.lottie)</p><p>• All exports maintain your animation timing and interactions</p><p>Is it free to try?</p><p>Yes! Phase is free to use.</p><p><br></p><p>We're here to help you succeed:</p><p>📧 Email: support@phase.com</p><p>💬 Community: Join our community: https://community.phase.com/c/questions/</p><p><br></p><p>⠀</p><p>Ready to ship real interactions?

      "description": "Relink a frame to a component by searching for similar instances.\n\n---\n\nUse cases:\n• Copying a nested component\n• Moving the master component to a different file\n• Turning a set of similar frames into a component\n• Turning detached instances back into instances\n\n---\n\nHow it works:\n 1. Select frames (that used to be instances)\n 2. Click \"Plugin/Reattach instance\"\n 3. Plugin finds instances or master components with the same name\n 4. New instance is created for each corresponding frame\n 5. The selected frames are replaced by instances 🎉\n\n👉 NEW: Overrides will now be applied to instances!\n\n---\n\nKnown problems:\n• Relies too much on layer naming\n• Needs to have an instance/master as a reference on the same file\n• Doesn't work all the time with team libraries\n\nFeel free to contribute 😅\nhttps://github.com/renancamm/figma-reattache-instance",

              "description": "Relink a frame to a component by searching for similar instances.\n\n---\n\nUse cases:\n• Copying a nested component\n• Moving the master component to a different file\n• Turning a set of similar frames into a component\n• Turning detached instances back into instances\n\n---\n\nHow it works:\n 1. Select frames (that used to be instances)\n 2. Click \"Plugin/Reattach instance\"\n 3. Plugin finds instances or master components with the same name\n 4. New instance is created for each corresponding frame\n 5. The selected frames are replaced by instances 🎉\n\n👉 NEW: Overrides will now be applied to instances!\n\n---\n\nKnown problems:\n• Relies too much on layer naming\n• Needs to have an instance/master as a reference on the same file\n• Doesn't work all the time with team libraries\n\nFeel free to contribute 😅\nhttps://github.com/renancamm/figma-reattache-instance",

This is ideal for pre-processing slides before exporting as PDF, as you can dramatically reduce the file size by cropping large fills and flattening layers of images and gradients into a single image. It is a simple image optimization &amp; compression technique that can be combined with post-processing the PDF for much smaller files.</p><p><br></p><p>Choose PNG if you are flattening images that require transparency, otherwise JPG (it will default to a white background).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a destructive action, so it is best to do it on a copy.</p>",

              "description": "<p>This plugin will convert each selected node to a flattened, rasterized image that is cropped to its actual size. This is ideal for pre-processing slides before exporting as PDF, as you can dramatically reduce the file size by cropping large fills and flattening layers of images and gradients into a single image. It is a simple image optimization &amp; compression technique that can be combined with post-processing the PDF for much smaller files.</p><p><br></p><p>Choose PNG if you are flattening images that require transparency, otherwise JPG (it will default to a white background).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a destructive action, so it is best to do it on a copy.</p>",

It provides three options: typing, deleting, and looping.</p><p><br></p><p>With the typing option, users can simulate the effect of text being typed out character by character, creating an animated typing effect. The plugin allows users to customize the typing speed, font, and other properties to achieve the desired effect.</p><p><br></p><p>The deleting option allows users to simulate the effect of text being erased character by character, mimicking the backspace or delete action. This can be useful for creating dynamic and interactive text animations within Figma designs.</p><p><br></p><p>The looping option allows users to continuously repeat the typing and deleting animation, creating an ongoing loop effect. This can be particularly handy for creating eye-catching and attention-grabbing text-based animations or prototypes.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, this Figma plugin offers a convenient way to add dynamic typing effects to text elements in Figma, enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of designs.</p>",

It provides three options: typing, deleting, and looping.</p><p><br></p><p>With the typing option, users can simulate the effect of text being typed out character by character, creating an animated typing effect. The plugin allows users to customize the typing speed, font, and other properties to achieve the desired effect.</p><p><br></p><p>The deleting option allows users to simulate the effect of text being erased character by character, mimicking the backspace or delete action. This can be useful for creating dynamic and interactive text animations within Figma designs.</p><p><br></p><p>The looping option allows users to continuously repeat the typing and deleting animation, creating an ongoing loop effect. This can be particularly handy for creating eye-catching and attention-grabbing text-based animations or prototypes.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, this Figma plugin offers a convenient way to add dynamic typing effects to text elements in Figma, enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of designs.</p>",

      "description": "When collaborating on features with multiple designers and developers, it can be hard to keep track of which designs are ready to be implemented and what is still a work in progress.\n\nStatus for Figma brings order to the chaos by providing a simple way to mark the status of a design. Simple right-click on your frame, go to Plugins, Status, and select your desired status.\n\nSome tips:\n- You can select multiple frames at once. Each frame will get its own status badge.\n- Use the keyboard shortcut to quickly set a status: hit `cmd /` in Mac and `ctrl /` on Windows, type a Status (e.g. “Done”) and hit return.\n- Status for Figma is not limited to frames. It works with any object you can select.\n- You can optionally automatically group the selected element and status badge, so they can be moved around easily (see the plugin settings)\n\nStatus for Figma is open source. Feel free to contribute or to send suggestions. https://github.com/bramschulting/status-for-figma",

              "description": "When collaborating on features with multiple designers and developers, it can be hard to keep track of which designs are ready to be implemented and what is still a work in progress.\n\nStatus for Figma brings order to the chaos by providing a simple way to mark the status of a design. Simple right-click on your frame, go to Plugins, Status, and select your desired status.\n\nSome tips:\n- You can select multiple frames at once. Each frame will get its own status badge.\n- Use the keyboard shortcut to quickly set a status: hit `cmd /` in Mac and `ctrl /` on Windows, type a Status (e.g. “Done”) and hit return.\n- Status for Figma is not limited to frames. It works with any object you can select.\n- You can optionally automatically group the selected element and status badge, so they can be moved around easily (see the plugin settings)\n\nStatus for Figma is open source. Feel free to contribute or to send suggestions. https://github.com/bramschulting/status-for-figma",

It is not necessary to enter both parameters. You can only enter offset or width.\n\nPlugin limitations:\n\n- You must enter at least one of the parameters: width or offset;\n- The root frame must have a grid;\n- The plugin only works with columns.\n\nPlans:\n\n- Preserving proportions;\n- Shift and resize of an object by 1 column at a time.",

It is not necessary to enter both parameters. You can only enter offset or width.\n\nPlugin limitations:\n\n- You must enter at least one of the parameters: width or offset;\n- The root frame must have a grid;\n- The plugin only works with columns.\n\nPlans:\n\n- Preserving proportions;\n- Shift and resize of an object by 1 column at a time.",

Select a layer/component and run Link to Documentation > Add Link.\n2. Enter a URL to your documentation page.\n3. Optionally, you can check \"Add 📖  emoji to layer name\" so it will be easier to tell which layers have documentations links.\n4. Click \"Add Link\".\n\nIf you are adding a link to a component, it is recommended to add it to the master component so all its instances will have access to the same link.\n\nIf you are adding a link to a team library component, make sure to publish an update of the library so other files using this component will have access to the link as well.\n\nRemove Link:\n1. Select a layer/component and run Link to Documentation > Remove Link.\n\nView Documentation:\n1. Select a layer/component with a documentation link. (See above)\n2. Run Link to Documentation > View Documentation.\n\n—————————————————————————————————\nNote:\nPlugins are currenly not available to users with read-only access to files. To work around this limitation, have your read-only users duplicate the file as a draft and use the plugin on their own copies.",

Select a layer/component and run Link to Documentation > Add Link.\n2. Enter a URL to your documentation page.\n3. Optionally, you can check \"Add 📖  emoji to layer name\" so it will be easier to tell which layers have documentations links.\n4. Click \"Add Link\".\n\nIf you are adding a link to a component, it is recommended to add it to the master component so all its instances will have access to the same link.\n\nIf you are adding a link to a team library component, make sure to publish an update of the library so other files using this component will have access to the link as well.\n\nRemove Link:\n1. Select a layer/component and run Link to Documentation > Remove Link.\n\nView Documentation:\n1. Select a layer/component with a documentation link. (See above)\n2. Run Link to Documentation > View Documentation.\n\n—————————————————————————————————\nNote:\nPlugins are currenly not available to users with read-only access to files.

Let’s look at some ways to achieve accurate results:</p><ul><li>Ensure that the frames have auto layout. It helps us to parse your Design better and also good for scaling designs in long term.</li><li>Mark the image/icon layers for export in the desirable format. We will import the asset in the selected format for you.</li><li>Avoid the use of Fixed Height/Width constraints as much as possible.
